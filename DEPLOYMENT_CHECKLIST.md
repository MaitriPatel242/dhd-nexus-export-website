# Website Deployment Checklist

## ✅ Good News: Your Access Key Works Everywhere!

Your Web3Forms access key (`10b31d2c-90fd-4648-80c9-8f97018c874f`) will work on your live website **without any changes**.

## 🔒 Important: Domain Whitelisting

When you go live, you need to **whitelist your domain** in Web3Forms:

### Steps to Whitelist Your Domain:

1. **Go to Web3Forms Dashboard:**
   - Visit: https://web3forms.com
   - Log in with your email: `maitri240205@gmail.com`

2. **Add Your Domain:**
   - Go to your access key settings
   - Add your live domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com` or `www.yourdomain.com`)
   - For localhost testing, it's already allowed automatically

3. **What to Add:**
   - If your site is: `https://dhdnexus.com` → Add: `dhdnexus.com`
   - If your site is: `https://www.dhdnexus.com` → Add: `www.dhdnexus.com`
   - Add both if you use both versions

## 📝 What You DON'T Need to Change:

✅ **Access Key** - Keep it as is (`10b31d2c-90fd-4648-80c9-8f97018c874f`)
✅ **Email Address** - Keep `maitri240205@gmail.com`
✅ **Form Code** - No changes needed in `contact.html` or `js/main.js`
✅ **Subject Line** - Already set correctly

## 🚀 Quick Deployment Steps:

1. **Upload your website** to your hosting (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, etc.)

2. **Whitelist your domain** in Web3Forms dashboard (see above)

3. **Test the form** on your live website

4. **Done!** The form will work exactly as it does locally

## ⚠️ Important Notes:

- **Free Plan Limit:** 250 submissions/month
- **Domain Security:** Whitelisting prevents others from using your access key
- **No Code Changes:** Everything works as-is once domain is whitelisted

## 🆘 If Form Doesn't Work After Going Live:

1. Check that your domain is whitelisted in Web3Forms
2. Make sure you're using `https://` (not `http://`)
3. Check browser console for any errors
4. Verify the access key is correct in `contact.html`

**Your form is ready to go live!** Just remember to whitelist your domain. 🎉
