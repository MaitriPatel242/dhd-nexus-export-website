# Using Live Server in Cursor 🚀

Since Cursor is based on VS Code, you can use the Live Server extension!

## Step 1: Install Live Server Extension

1. In Cursor, click the **Extensions** icon in the left sidebar (or press `Ctrl+Shift+X`)
2. Search for **"Live Server"** by Ritwick Dey
3. Click **Install**

## Step 2: Start the Server

1. In Cursor, right-click on `contact.html` in the file explorer
2. Select **"Open with Live Server"**
3. Your browser will automatically open at `http://127.0.0.1:5500/contact.html`

## Step 3: Test the Form

1. Fill out the contact form
2. Submit it
3. Check `maitri240205@gmail.com` for the email

**That's it!** The server runs in the background and the form will work perfectly.
