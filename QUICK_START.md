   - Click the Extensions icon (or press `Ctrl+Shift+X`)
   - Search for "Live Server" by Ritwick Dey
   - Click "Install"

2. **Start the Server:**
   - Right-click on `contact.html` in VS Code
   - Select **"Open with Live Server"**
   - Your browser will open automatically at `http://127.0.0.1:5500/contact.html`

3. **Test the Form:**
   - Fill out and submit the contact form
   - Check `maitri240205@gmail.com` for the email

**That's it!** The server runs automatically and the form will work.
