# Favicon Size Issue - Important Note

## Why Favicons Look Small

**Browser tabs display favicons at a fixed small size (16x16 pixels)** - this is a browser limitation and cannot be changed. Favicons will always appear small in browser tabs.

## What I've Done

I've added larger favicon sizes (up to 512x512) so browsers can use high-resolution versions. This ensures the favicon looks **crisp and clear** even at the small 16x16 size.

## To Make It Look Better

**The source image (`assets/Favicon.png`) should be:**
- At least **512x512 pixels** (or larger)
- High quality and clear
- Square format
- Simple design (works better at small sizes)

## If It Still Looks Small/Blurry

1. **Replace the favicon image:**
   - Create a new favicon at **512x512 pixels** or larger
   - Use a simple, bold design
   - Save as PNG format
   - Replace `assets/Favicon.png` with the new file

2. **Alternative: Use your header logo**
   - If `header_logo.png` is high quality, you could use that
   - Just make sure it's at least 512x512 pixels

3. **Clear browser cache:**
   - Hard refresh: `Ctrl+F5` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
   - Or clear browser cache completely

## Remember

Favicons in browser tabs are **always small** - that's how browsers work. But with a high-resolution source image, it will look **sharp and clear** instead of blurry.
