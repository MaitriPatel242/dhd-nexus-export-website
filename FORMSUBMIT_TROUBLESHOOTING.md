# FormSubmit Activation Email Not Received

## Troubleshooting Steps:

### 1. Check Spam/Junk Folder
- Check your Gmail spam folder
- Search for emails from "formsubmit.co" or "noreply@formsubmit.co"
- Sometimes Gmail filters these emails

### 2. Wait a Few Minutes
- Activation emails can take 2-5 minutes to arrive
- Check again after waiting

### 3. Try Resubmitting the Form
- Sometimes resubmitting triggers a new activation email
- Make sure you're accessing via `http://localhost:5500` (not file://)

### 4. Check Email Address
- Make sure `maitri240205@gmail.com` is correct
- Try accessing the activation page directly: https://formsubmit.co/maitri240205@gmail.com

### 5. Try a Different Email
- FormSubmit might have issues with certain email providers
- You could temporarily use a different email to test
